          At <strong>35peti.com</strong>, we encourage all users to enjoy

          <h5 className="fw-semibold">1. Our Commitment</h5>
          <p>
            We are fully committed to promoting a safe, fair, and responsible
            gaming environment. Betting involves financial risk, and players
            should always play within their limits and means.

          <h5 className="fw-semibold">2. Know the Risks</h5>
          <p>
            Gambling can be addictive if not controlled. Always remember:
            <ul>
              <li>Bet only what you can afford to lose.</li>
              <li>Do not chase your losses.</li>
              <li>Set time and money limits before you start.</li>
              <li>Take regular breaks while playing.</li>
              <li>Never gamble when upset, tired, or under the influence.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

        <section className="mb-4">
          <h5 className="fw-semibold">3. Play for Fun</h5>
          <p>
            Online betting and casino games are designed for fun and
            entertainment. They should never be seen as a guaranteed source of
            income. Treat every game as a form of leisure — not an investment.

          <h5 className="fw-semibold">4. Age Restriction</h5>
          <p>
            Only users aged <strong>18 years or older</strong> (or the legal
            gambling age in your jurisdiction) are allowed to register and place
            bets. Any account found violating this rule may be suspended
            immediately.
